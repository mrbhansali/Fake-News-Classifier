Fake News Classifier using Machine Learning
This project is a Fake News Detection system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. It classifies news articles as real or fake based on their textual content by leveraging both vectorization techniques and various classification models.

Project Overview
Loaded and preprocessed a labeled news dataset

Converted text into numerical form using:

CountVectorizer

TF-IDF Vectorizer

Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Passive Aggressive Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Compared models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

 Best Performance
 Achieved 91.61% accuracy using the Random Forest Classifier with TF-IDF Vectorizer

Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
